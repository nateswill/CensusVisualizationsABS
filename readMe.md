 **Datasets**  
            We explored the four datasets from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2019 Annual Business Survey (ABS) APIs website, which can be accessed [here](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/abs.2019.html). Though titled as 2019, the U.S. Census conducted this survey for U.S. businesses in 2018. The data is particular to that year.
            
   The four datasets we called using specific APIs for each were (click on link for API call url):  
    1. [Company Summary](https://api.census.gov/data/2018/abscs.html)  
    2. [Characteristics of Businesses](https://api.census.gov/data/2018/abscb.html)  
    3. [Characteristics of Business Owners](https://api.census.gov/data/2018/abscbo.html)  
    4. [Technology Characteristics of Businesses](https://api.census.gov/data/2018/abstcb.html)  

 **Questions**  
  Here are the four main questions that we investigated during this project:  
    
   1. How does worker pay and employment type vary by owner race and gender?  
   2. How does veteran business ownership vary by gender, race, and service-disability status?  
   3. How is technology used across businesses?  
   4. How does owner education attainment relate to annual pay within different industries?  
    
 
 **ETL**  
We conducted the extract, transformation, and load process for these datasets using pandas in Jupyter notebooks. You can find the detailed, step-by-step ETL report within this repository as a PDF document [here](ETL-report-group6.pdf). By following this document, you should be able to replicate our ETL process. 

You can also find the Jupyter notebook step by step of the ETL process in the Jupyter notebook file [here](ETL-section-4-visualizations.ipynb). This file also contains the visualizations to answer our forth question as well.

 **Visualizations**  
We each created 4-5 visualizations to answer the questions addressed above. These visualizations can be found in slideshow format in the slideshow pdf [here](visualizations-slideshow.pdf).   
        
The visualizations and their code can be found in the following listed Jupyter Notebooks:  

1. [section-1-visualizations](section1visualizations.ipynb) displays visualizations and their code to answer our first question on how worker pay and employment type varies by owner race and gender  
2. [section-2-visualizations](section-2-visualizations-code.ipynb) displays visualizations and their code to answer our second question on how veteran business ownership varies by gender, race, and service-disability status  
3. [section-3-visualizations](section-3-visualizations-code.ipynb) displays visualizations and their code to answer our third question on how technology is used across businesses  
4. [section-4-visualizations](ETL-section-4-visualizations.ipynb) displays visualizations and theircode to answer our fourth question on how owner education attainment relates to annual pay in different industries  

Finally, visualizations are also displayed and discussed in our final report pdf document, [here](Group-6-Report.pdf).

**Report**  
In the [report](Group-6-Report.pdf), we display and discuss all visualizations and how they answer (or sometimes fail to answer) our exploratory questions. This report can be found in the report pdf document. The report contains an introduction, display and discussion of visualizations broken down into four sections (for the four main questions), conclusion, and a works cited page.
